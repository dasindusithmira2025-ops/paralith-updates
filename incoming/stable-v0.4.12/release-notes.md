# PARALITH Stable 0.4.12

Channel: stable
Date: 2026-08-13
Git commit: 159e4351bb6b178182b6855b0b4bb890d00ab241
Database schema: 29

## Highlights
- Database Studio: discovered sources are now classified by how closely they resemble the application's own database, so a repository's test fixtures stop being presented as first-class production datasources
- Database Studio: failures now surface the backend's actual cause alongside its message instead of a generic "could not access its local database", and a layer with nothing behind it yet is now distinguished from a genuinely empty schema
- Database Studio: foreign-key relationships display One → One vs Many → One cardinality, derived only from constraint evidence (never guessed from naming)

## Fixes
- None

## Database changes
- Schema v29 adds database_sources.relevance; existing rows default to 'application' so nothing already surfaced disappears on upgrade

## Known issues
- Database Studio: Drizzle change generation is not implemented; a Drizzle-only source refuses implementation with a clear error rather than writing something wrong
- Database Studio: PostgreSQL/MySQL network introspection and any credential store remain absent by design
- A Windows protected-process, driver, or component-store fault can force a restart independently of PARALITH and cannot be repaired from within the application
- Windows component-store and protected-file verification require an elevated Administrator console
- Open in default app remains restricted by the opener path policy; Reveal in file explorer is available
- GitHub App installation-token exchange and public webhook ingress require the separately deployed Corelith backend service
- Remote repository synchronization remains explicit-refresh only
- Commit history is read on demand for the selected repository or worktree; it does not refresh automatically as new commits land

## Required manual actions
- Use the in-app Stable update button and approve the safe restart; no manual installer download is required
