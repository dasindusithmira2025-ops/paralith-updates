# PARALITH Stable 0.4.16

Channel: stable
Date: 2026-08-25
Git commit: f13704ae7979d96ea05abbbf113b5f025ad57abc
Database schema: 39

## Highlights
- Memory now follows project file changes from the Project session lifecycle instead of depending on Code Surface being open
- Changed source evidence can now supersede obsolete Memory and create current replacement knowledge with provenance
- Run Engine and Mission Control remain included with durable Project-scoped execution and orchestration surfaces
- Source Control remains focused on workspace worktrees while preserving queued repository operations

## Fixes
- Stale or superseded Memory is no longer injected as normal current project truth during context compilation
- Context cache entries are invalidated when Memory is learned, superseded, marked stale, or candidate processing affects project truth
- Literal/config source changes can update Memory deterministically without calling Claude or Codex
- Ambiguous source changes are routed to existing Memory review candidates instead of being silently promoted

## Database changes
- Schema v37 refreshes built-in Swarm presets so concrete agent allocations carry canonical provider and model identities
- Schema v38 adds the canonical Runs, Run events, and Run approvals tables for durable agent execution history
- Schema v39 installs Mission Control tables, correlates Runs with Missions and Mission Tasks, and keeps Run history when a Mission is deleted
- Schema v39 retires the abandoned v7 Mission table cluster; non-empty legacy rows are preserved under _legacy_v7 table names instead of being dropped
- User-created Swarm presets, Projects, Workspaces, terminals, Missions, Memory rows, Database Studio data, Usage history, settings, and Stable updater state are preserved through forward migrations

## Known issues
- The Vault Markdown directory is a generated review surface; the runtime SQLite database remains the canonical source for in-app memory and evidence
- Editing generated Vault notes outside PARALITH does not yet import changes back into the runtime database
- Deep cross-file architectural inference and broad language-specific rename analysis remain intentionally conservative; ambiguous changes enter Memory review
- Usage cost is an equivalent API list-price estimate, not a provider subscription bill; models without a known rate keep their tokens visible and make the total partial
- Database Studio: Drizzle change generation is not implemented; a Drizzle-only source refuses implementation with a clear error rather than writing something wrong
- Database Studio: PostgreSQL/MySQL network introspection and any credential store remain absent by design
- A Windows protected-process, driver, or component-store fault can force a restart independently of PARALITH and cannot be repaired from within the application
- Windows component-store and protected-file verification require an elevated Administrator console
- Open in default app remains restricted by the opener path policy; Reveal in file explorer is available
- GitHub App installation-token exchange and public webhook ingress require the separately deployed Corelith backend service
- Remote repository synchronization remains explicit-refresh only
- Commit history is read on demand for the selected repository or worktree; it does not refresh automatically as new commits land

## Required manual actions
- Use the in-app Stable update button and approve the safe restart; no manual installer download is required
